I received my PhD degree from the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Osaka University in 2025. I was affiliated with [the Bio-Inspired Networking Laboratory](http://www-waka.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/index.php/en) during my studies. I will be working in the industry.

## Research

My research has focused on swarm guidance and shepherding problem. I am currently interested in applying reinforcement learning to autonomous driving  PnC and Game AI.

## Selected projects
1. Strategy-based Reinforcement Learning in Swarm Shepherding.
2. Swarm Shepherding using Bearing-only Measurements, <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A</em>, 2025. <br>
